            Being up to date with the latest technical developments is important in the development of software.
            However, it is also important to deal with these in depth and then be able to implement and deploy them for their own projects.

            Because, if you do, you can create something that really matters.
            Over the past few years I have come across stunning personalities and interesting individuals.
            Through these encounters I have been able to learn to deal with complex opinions as well as crashing spaceships into gas planets.

            After quite a long time of always changing environments,
            I eventually met some great people who gave me the opportunity to work on projects that are outside my comfort zone.
            And I'm looking forward to the many projects that will follow.
